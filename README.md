## Introduction

The **Developer** repository aims to simplify and enhance the developer experience by providing robust tools that leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows for seamless remote execution of tasks on Linux servers, making it easier for developers to manage their environments and applications.

## Features

- **Remote Execution**: Run scripts directly on your Linux server.
- **File Operations**: Manage files with easeâ€”upload, download, and manipulate files remotely.
- **SQL Queries**: Execute SQL commands securely through the API.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with multiple programming languages including JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Bash.
- **Secure HTTP API**: Ensures that all communications are encrypted and secure.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Developer** tools, you will need to download the latest release. You can find the releases [here](https://github.com/KielEvandro/developer/releases). Download the necessary files and follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/KielEvandro/developer/releases) section to find the latest version. Download the appropriate file for your system.

2. **Extract the Files**: After downloading, extract the files to your desired directory.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can use package managers like `npm`, `pip`, or `composer` depending on the language you choose.

4. **Configure the API**: Update the configuration files with your server details and authentication tokens.

5. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start using the tools.

## Usage

### Remote Execution

To execute a script on your Linux server, use the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-server/api/execute \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
-d '{"script": "your_script.sh"}'
```

### File Operations

To upload a file to your server:

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-server/api/upload \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
-F "file=@path/to/your/file.txt"
```

To download a file from your server:

```bash
curl -X GET http://your-server/api/download?file=your_file.txt \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" -o your_file.txt
```

### SQL Queries

To execute an SQL query:

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-server/api/sql \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
-d '{"query": "SELECT * FROM your_table;"}'
```
